LCD display to fit on the 16x2 screen 
//02/08/23
I modified the module user_interface, I only modified the user_interface.cpp. I changed the  displayCharPositionWrite() so that Tmp and Gas were on the same line and Alarm 
was right below. The I changed Temperature to Tmp and, Not detected to ND, and Detected to D. I did this so that it can fit on the screen .
